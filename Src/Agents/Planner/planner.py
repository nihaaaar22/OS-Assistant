#module for planning i.e. breaking down the tasks into multiple subtasks. The tasks are stored
#and then provided as a list to the executor
#currently i am passing in the query in the planner stage itself. However need another
#utils module that will take query args along with other args such as file path for local files
#for now the planner will itself call the executor but later it needs to be done by an 
#external orchestratro

class planner():
    def __init__(self,query):
        self.query = query

    def run():
        pass
    #decomposes the tasks
